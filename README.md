## The Goal
Everyone knows that dollar pizza is the best deal in the city (maybe the world?). In this lab we are going to build a website for Jeff's Dollar Pizza shop using React.

## The Lab
Launch instructions for how to start the lab (this may include npm installations, run commands, and other setup instructions). If necessary, include ### headers for leveled challenges that are better described here in the readme than in the lab.
