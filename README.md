# Dollar Pizza - React

![alt-text-includes-image-credit](dollar-pizza-website.png)

## The Goal
Everyone knows that dollar pizza is the best deal in the city (maybe the world). In this lab we are going to finish building a website for Jeff's Dollar Pizza shop using React.

Jeff hired a web developer to start the website. Sadly, the developer got tired of New York City winters, moved to Thailand, and works as a full-time yoga instructor at a boutique all inclusive hotel. Jeff can't get in contact with the developer and all he has left is the incomplete code for the website.

Our job is to complete the website for Jeff's Dollar Pizza so it looks like the mock-up above.

## The Lab
Launch instructions for how to start the lab (this may include npm installations, run commands, and other setup instructions). If necessary, include ### headers for leveled challenges that are better described here in the readme than in the lab.
